# ✅ Airport API Integration - Update Summary

## 🎯 What Was Updated

Based on your actual API structure, I've updated the airport integration to properly handle:

1. **AirportGroup types** with subAirports
2. **SingleAirport types**
3. **Detailed airport information** (city, timezone, coordinates)

---

## 📝 Files Modified

### 1. `src/services/flightsService.js`

**Added 2 new functions:**

```javascript
// Get airport by code (detailed info)
getAirportByCode('DXB')
// Returns: city, timezone, latitude, longitude, etc.

// Get all airports with flattening
getAllAirports(100, true)
// Returns: All airports as flat list
```

**Updated existing function:**

```javascript
// Now automatically flattens airport groups
searchAirports('dubai', 10)
// Extracts subAirports from AirportGroup responses
```

### 2. `src/components/flights/AirportAutocomplete.jsx`

**Enhanced display format:**
- Shows city when available: `DXB - Dubai (Dubai)`
- Better formatting for airports with different city names: `LHR - London Heathrow (London)`

## 🔌 Your API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/airports/search?q=dubai&limit=10` | GET | Search airports (autocomplete) |
| `/api/airports/DXB` | GET | Get detailed airport info by code |
| `/api/airports?limit=100&active=true` | GET | Get all airports |

## 🎨 How It Works

### Airport Groups (Automatic Flattening)

**Your API returns:**
```json
{
  "__typename": "AirportGroup",
  "title": "United Arab Emirates",
  "subAirports": [
    { "code": "AUH", "title": "Abu Dhabi" },
    { "code": "DXB", "title": "Dubai" },
    { "code": "SHJ", "title": "Sharjah" }
  ]
}
```

**We automatically flatten to:**
```json
[
  { "code": "AUH", "title": "Abu Dhabi", "country": "United Arab Emirates" },
  { "code": "DXB", "title": "Dubai", "country": "United Arab Emirates" },
  { "code": "SHJ", "title": "Sharjah", "country": "United Arab Emirates" }
]
```

This means users see **individual airports** in the dropdown, not groups! ✨

## ✅ What This Means For You

1. **No code changes needed** - Everything works automatically
2. **Better UX** - Users see all airports, not groups
3. **More data** - Access to timezone, coordinates, city names
4. **Backward compatible** - Existing code still works

---

## 🧪 Quick Test

1. **Start your server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/flights/search
   ```

3. **Test these searches:**
   - Type "dubai" → Should show "DXB - Dubai"
   - Type "london" → Should show "LHR - London Heathrow", "LGW - London Gatwick"
   - Type "india" → Should show all 5 Indian airports individually
